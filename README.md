# Covid-19 Portfolio Project

Hello all! This is a data science project that has came up in my current course I am following.

Using information from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths, I obtained the csv files that contained all updated COVID-19 data. 
I was able to sort these csv files into two seperate sheets, one containing information on deaths and infections, and another with vaccination data. I uploaded both of these
workbooks into SQL (I used SSMS for this project). I was able to join these tables together, clean the data up a bit, and write multiple quieries to sort out some key facts. Some of these queiries were in the 
course, but I also made some on my own to further practice. I then put these quiries into views, and I plan to pull them into a visualizaiton software such as Tableu in the future. 

Thanks for checking out my first SQL project!
